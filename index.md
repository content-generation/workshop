## First Workshop on Content understanding and generation at KDD 2022

Shopping experience on any e-commerce website is largely driven by the content customers interact with. The large volume of diverse content on e-commerce platforms, and the advances in machine learning, provide opportunity for gathering insights from e-commerce content and build systems that can reliably generate content to improve shopper experience. The first workshop on content understanding and generation for the e-commerce aims to bring together researchers from industry and academia to discuss recent advances and challenges specific to thes areas. 

### Call for papers

The workshop is a half-day event. We solicit two types of submissions â€“ full papers of 6 pages and short papers of at most 2 pages. We encourage submission of novel work-in-progress papers that show promising directions or demonstration systems, to facilitate discussion during the workshop. We will look to accept 4-6 papers (including full and short papers) peer-reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. The workshop will solicit contributions related to the theme of supporting generation and curation of content for e-commerce which includes (but is not limited to):

- Cold start brand/product summary or promotional video generation
- Novel approaches to generate and evaluate product catalogue, review and comparison summaries
- Multimodal and multi-view content modelling aggregating information from multiple product data sources (including text, images, and video) to support product description or advertisement creation
- Multimodal techniques for matching image and text from product feature/advertisement videos and product description
- Multimodal techniques for understanding affective expressions, including non-visual signals such as audio or speech from product videos and advertisements
- Multimodal action/scene recognition in product feature/advertisement videos across product verticals like sports, healthcare, entertainment or lifestyle
- Domain adaptation methods for understanding user submitted product review texts and images
- Domain adaptation methods for recognition of products in non-natural datasets
- Transfer learning applying models trained on prior datasets on a new type of product or category
- Different approaches and metrics to assess the visual appeal of e-commerce content
- Product catalogue moderation and optimization
- Guided generative models for images, audio and videos based on product script and brand story
- Product description or brand store layout/template generation guided by business metrics such as click through rate (CTR) or revenue
- Generation of interpretable and actionable insights from product catalogue and user submitted reviews for content creators
- Few shot learning approaches to bootstrap generation models for new brands, products or demographics
- Evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated content
